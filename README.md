## Description
This is a solution implementation for Interval merge problem.   
#### Problem:  
Implement a Function MERGE that accepts a List of Intervals and returns
a List as a result.    
The result should merge overlapping intervals and keep all non overlapping intervals untouched.   

Example:  
Input: [25,30] [2,19] [14, 23] [4,8]  
Output: [2,23] [25,30]

## Usage  
#### Compile the project  
``` shell script
mvn clean compile assembly:single
```

#### Run performance tests
run the following command from the root of the project  
``` shell script
java -Dtest=AppTest#testPerformance test
```
  
#### Execute the program
run the following command from the root of the project  
```shell script
cd target   
java -jar intervalmerge.jar [25,30] [2,19] [14, 23] [4,8]
```
